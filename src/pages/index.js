        <p className="text-lg">Your reliable partner in helping monitor defendants out on bond and probation. Our innovative tool aids prosecuting attorneys in Missouri by automatically searching Casenet weekly, identifying those who violate the terms of their release by picking up new cases. Our mission is to arm prosecutors with the information to hold defendants accountable for not committing new law violations while their cases are pending, thus helping limit potential dangers to the community.</p>

        <p>At Your Company Name, we identified that it is difficult to know what defendants are doing in other jurisdictions in Missouri. Our team is committed to delivering the monitoring tools to prosecuting attorneys to uphold the Courtâ€™s conditions. Because justice delayed is justice denied, we search Casenet automatically every week, instead of waiting for information to be shared by chance to an attorney.</p>
